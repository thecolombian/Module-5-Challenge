# Pymaceuticals Inc. Study Findings

Pymaceuticals Inc. conducted a study with 249 mice diagnosed with SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) tumors over 45 days. The primary aim was to assess the efficacy of Capomulin compared to other treatments. Tumor development was measured to gather accurate data on each drug regimen's performance.

## Key Visualizations and Insights

### Tumor Size Reduction
- **Capomulin and Ramicane:** The study revealed that both Capomulin and Ramicane were notably effective in reducing tumor size. These two drugs outperformed the other treatment regimens, demonstrating their potential as powerful anti-tumor agents. The visualizations indicate a significant decrease in tumor volume in mice treated with Capomulin and Ramicane, highlighting their therapeutic efficacy.

### Correlation Between Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume
- **Positive Correlation:** A detailed analysis of the data revealed a strong positive correlation (0.84) between the weight of the mice and the average tumor volume. It suggests that as the weight of the mice increased, the average tumor volume also tended to increase. This finding underscores the importance of considering the weight of the mice when evaluating tumor growth and treatment efficacy, as it may influence the overall results.

### Treatment Frequency
- **Number of Mice Tested:** The bar graph included in the study illustrates that Capomulin and Ramicane were tested on the most significant number of mice. This higher frequency of testing reinforces the reliability of the results and indicates a focused effort to evaluate these two drugs comprehensively. The substantial number of mice tested with Capomulin and Ramicane provides a robust dataset, enhancing the credibility of the findings related to these treatments.

## Conclusion

The study conducted by Pymaceuticals Inc. provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of various drug regimens in treating SCC tumor growth in mice. Capomulin and Ramicane emerged as the most promising treatments, significantly reducing tumor size. Additionally, the strong positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume offers an important consideration for future research and treatment evaluations. The extensive testing of Capomulin and Ramicane further supports their potential as effective anti-tumor agents.
